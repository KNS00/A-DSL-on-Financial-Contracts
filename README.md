# Management of Financial Contracts: A Study on the Potential of a Domain Specific Language

This project is in the early stages of development. The idea is to create a DSL inspired by the article "Composing Contracts: An Adventure in Finanical Engineering, by Simon Peyton Jones, Jean-Marc Eber and Julian Seward", Martin Elsmans FP For Trade Management presentation (2010, SimCorp), and the article "An embedded DSL for Stochastic Processes" by Michael Werk, Joakim Ahnfelt-RÃ¸nne and Ken Friis.

The idea is to create a domain specific language tailored for financial derivates in the functional language F#. The project composes theory in mathematical finance & stochastic processes with fundamentals in functional programming.
